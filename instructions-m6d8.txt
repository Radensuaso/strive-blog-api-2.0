Today you continue building Blog Posts API

 

Your backend should now have the possibility to add a comment to an article. Mongo's preferred data design should be to embed comments into blog posts if possible, therefore you should implement the following endpoints

GET /blogPosts/:id/comments => returns all the comments for the specified blog post
GET /blogPosts/:id/comments/:commentId=> returns a single comment for the specified blog post
POST /blogPosts/:id => adds a new comment for the specified blog post
PUT /blogPosts/:id/comment/:commentId => edit the comment belonging to the specified blog post
DELETE /blogPosts/:id/comment/:commentId=> delete the comment belonging to the specified blog post
 

EXTRA
Implement pagination in GET /blogPosts route
